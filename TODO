Possible next steps:
* Exit in session scoped fixture if FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST is not set.
* Similarly, probe emulator with short timeout and exit if it fails.
* Derive FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST from firebase.json.
* Run tests under control of firebase emulators:exec in Github action.
* Test Github action with act.
* Too fancy: if emulator is not running, try starting and detaching it,
  and parsing stdout/stderr to determine success.
